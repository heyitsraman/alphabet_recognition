# alphabet_recognition
This project was my Final Semester Major Project alongwith my classmate. The usability of the project is being explored further now by the Research Scholars of the college.
We here tried to use gesture recognition to make our system identify the English alphabets, and in return it would typecast the same to the message conveyor, hence proving a better tool than using a keyboard or virtual keyboard.
